How It Works:
---------------
This project showcases the use of Django's Model-View-Template (MVT) architecture:

Models: The StudentData model is defined in models.py, representing the structure of student records.

Views: The views handle the application logic, interacting with the models and rendering the appropriate templates based on user requests.

Templates: HTML templates are used to create a user interface. Forms for creating and updating student data are rendered with Django's template system, allowing for easy data input.

Without using Django, creating a similar application would require implementing routing, request handling, and database interactions manually. You would have to manage your own HTTP requests and responses, handle form submissions in plain HTML, and utilize a database connection to store and retrieve student records. Using Django simplifies these processes, allowing you to focus on building the application rather than dealing with the underlying infrastructure.

Conclusion:
------------
This project demonstrates the fundamental principles of web development using Django.
It illustrates how to effectively manage student data through a user-friendly interface. 
By leveraging Django's capabilities, I created a robust and maintainable application that streamlines the process of student record management.
